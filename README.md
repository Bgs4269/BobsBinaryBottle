Concept implementation of Bob's binary time capsule in 'Tales from the Deep'

# Placeholder. Upload expected around August 2025.

# Background story
Imagine if you had the chance to send out binary information into interstellar space in a data storage that can store it for millions of years or more.
How would you approach the problem? Imagine yourself in the place of an alien race, or as a human receiving such data. You must build up ways to communicate and then share information with just a sequence of bits.

In the novel _Tales from the Deep_, the character Bob builds a time capsule and includes a WORM data storage based on monocrystals and multiple lasers. In the story, these are meant for slow write and long storage, focusing on vital logs in a black box fashion, and certain backups.
In the story, he finds a way to send it out of the solar system, but the novel intentionally keeps the content vague.

# The challenge
In this repository, I'm sharing an example implementation of said binary data, and offer it, as a game challenge for you to interpret it, and make sense of the content. After all, if we humans can't break it, what could we expect from an alien race?

If the concept is viable, an updated version may one day go into interstellar space on a future space probe.
